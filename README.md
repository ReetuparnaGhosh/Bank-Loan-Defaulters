# Bank-Loan-Defaulters
Identifying  Possible Defaulters
INTRO
A bank is offering services to private persons, which include managing of accounts, offering loans, etc. The bank desires to improve their services by finding interesting groups of clients by identifying the probable loan defaulters. So the bank managers hope to find some answers (and questions as well) by analyzing this data. In this project, I am going to follow the basic process of loan default prediction.
